          DigVault Ltd, trading as Payback, offers assistance to consumers
          seeking advice and guidance. Our services are provided by competent
          attorneys licensed by the Israel Bar Association, who supervise the
          provision of services. We specialize in recovery consulting, guiding
          clients through the process of canceling transactions and obtaining
          refunds using alternative dispute resolution methods outside of court.
          It&apos;s important to note that we do not serve as legal
          representatives for our clients and are not obligated to participate
          in any litigation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings.

          Additionally, we cannot guarantee the outcome or result of our
          recovery consulting services. We provide consumers with a free initial
          consultation, after which recovery consulting services may be
          commissioned and will involve fees and/or commissions based on the
          service and the complexity of each case, as outlined in the contract.
          Cancellation of services under the contract follows the provisions of
          the Israeli Consumer Protection Law (Transaction Cancellation), 2010,
          Section 2(3).
